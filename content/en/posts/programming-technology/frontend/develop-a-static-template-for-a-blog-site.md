# Develop a static template for a blog site

Since building a personal website, I have successively used pure static,
Typecheo, self-built server, Hexo, Hugo, etc., but most of them have always used
some official templates provided by their respective companies, which are
basically developed by others, and some are easy to use. , I have also modified
and optimized some, but there are always places I am not used to, especially I
have obsessive-compulsive disorder. For some templates, the UI may be good to
use, but the console will have a lot of errors. I am I can‚Äôt see the person who
reported the red on the console (of course, you can forgive the yellow), so I
plan to make a theme of my own style. The name is named after my name
"Misitebao". At present, a foundation has just been built. The framework will be
gradually optimized when there is time. The goal is to provide a standard
solution template that can be used by other template engines.
