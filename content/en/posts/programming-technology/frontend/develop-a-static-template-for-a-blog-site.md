# Develop a static template for a blog site

> My name is „Äå[Misitebao](http://misitebao.com)„Äç, and this article was first published on „Äå[Misitebao's Blog](http://blog.misitebao.com)„Äç.

Since building a personal website, I have successively used pure static, Typecheo, self-built server, Hexo, Hugo, etc., but most of them have always used some official templates provided by their respective companies, which are basically developed by others, and some are easy to use. , I have also modified and optimized some, but there are always places I am not used to, especially I have obsessive-compulsive disorder. For some templates, the UI may be good to use, but the console will have a lot of errors. I am I can‚Äôt see the person who reported the red on the console (of course, you can forgive the yellow), so I plan to make a theme of my own style. The name is named after my name "Misitebao". At present, a foundation has just been built. The framework will be gradually optimized when there is time. The goal is to provide a standard solution template that can be used by other template engines.
